Leveraging libraries like `react`, `styled-components` and `redux` (among others) to shape the frontend bits of our organization. Typescript gave me the flexibility of working with JavaScript while keeping compile-time typechecking. |

Worked a lot with Java in university, where I made a multiplayer game based on a client-server architecture with one of the most talented and dedicated engineers that I know. Other cool projects include a code analysis tool, various sorting algorithms and a IoT alarm system. |
