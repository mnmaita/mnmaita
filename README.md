Leveraging libraries like `react`, `styled-components` and `redux` (among others) to shape the frontend bits of our organization. Typescript gave me the flexibility of working with JavaScript while keeping compile-time typechecking. |

Tried (and failed ðŸ˜…) to build a few complex projects, which made me learn a lot about the capabilities of the language. I'm now focused on working with libraries that support game development like `sdl2_rust`, `ggez` and `bevy`, testing those on personal projects while contributing upstream.  |

Worked a lot with Java in university, where I made a multiplayer game based on a client-server architecture with one of the most talented and dedicated engineers that I know. Other cool projects include a code analysis tool, various sorting algorithms and a IoT alarm system. |
